This website serves a number of purposes:

+ There's a [blog](/posts)
+ There's a [gadgets](/gadgets) section
+ There's a [Hugo](/hugo) section

> Whenever I research a problem or question online, I always appreciate when some blogger took the time to write up that exact issue. Maybe some random post that I write will be useful to other people in turn.  Perhaps that person will be ***me***, when I inevitably run into the same issue six months later and forget what I knew!"

### Does this blog have an ambition? {#ambition}
I hope that some of the information on this website is useful to somebody (maybe ***you***). In a fantasy world I'd like this website to be amazingly popular and perhaps even generate a little money. I'm pretty much retired and every little helps!
