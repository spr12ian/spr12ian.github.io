### Can I bypass 'hugo new *filename*'? {#hugo-new-filename}
I use VS Code as my IDE of choice. Often, when starting a new page (or post) for Hugo, I would like to copy a current page and modify the copy rather than starting from an empty new page. I can do that easily from within the IDE without having to access a command line to issue a command like ```hugo new folder/folder2/folder3/filename.md```


Why can't I just create a .md file using VS in any subfolder of the content folder?
