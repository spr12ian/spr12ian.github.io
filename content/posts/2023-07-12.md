## There's been some progress

I must remember to remove the passphrase from my ssh setup.

Years ago a cousin, who runs a small business, fell victim to ransomware; before ransomware was known to be a real thing. I could barely believe it at the the time because I thought those sort of criminals only targeted bigger fish. I was wrong and it cost the business a considerable amount of money to resolve the problem. Trying to deal with the issue with antivirus/antimalware software after the fact was a waste of time. Since then my security awareness has been heightened, but the passphrase on my ssh setup is overkill.

Early on in my long career I would have classed myself as a Unix Guru. I'd mastered both the blue book & the red book, as well as a thorough knowledge of K&R. I've forgotten a lot of it since then.

I can make changes on my phone, when I'm out and about, using the GitHub app. How do I 'hugo new' remotely, to create new posts?

 My quick fix to the themes submodile problem will be to clone the theme the delete the .git folder from the theme subfolder.

 cd themes
 git clone https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git ananke

 rm -rf ananke/.gits
