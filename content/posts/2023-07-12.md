## It's all too much

My [GitHub](https://github.com/) synchronisation efforts have gone a bit wrong. I may have to start again. My home page shows links to the first three posts that I've set up but not the contents of the posts, not even when I click on the links.

I must remember to remove the passphrase from my ssh setup.

Years ago a cousin, who runs a small business, fell victim to ransomware; before ransomware was known to be a real thing. I could barely believe it at the the time because I thought those sort of criminals only targeted bigger fish. I was wrong and it cost the business a considerable amount of money to resolve the problem. Trying to deal with the issue with antivirus/antimalware software after the fact was a waste of time. Since then my security awareness has been heightened, but the passphrase on my ssh setup is overkill.

Early on in my long career I would have classed myself as a Unix Guru. I'd mastered both the blue book & the red book, as well as a thorough knowledge of K&R. I've forgotten a lot of it since then. :)

 Today I need to diff two Linux folders to track down where I've gone wrong with my [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) setup. I have a projects folder with two *Hugo* projects:
 1) hugo-quickstart
 2) spr12ian.github.io
 I need to play spot the difference. The hugo-quickstart folder correctly shows post content. The other does not.

 I also need to improve my markup. e.g. The two folders above should be bullet pointed or numerically listed somehow. It's all a work in progress.

 First I try:
 diff -r hugo-quickstart/ spr12ian.github.io/

 The main difference I see is that I have the ananke theme installed on hugo-quickstart but not on spr12ian.github.io. I seem to recall a problem with using a submodule in a Hugo project when trying to use Actions on GitHub to build the blog.

 Further investiagation suggests Hugo modules may be the way to go. Will that work with my version of Hugo (v0.92.2)?

 My quick fix will be to clone the theme the delete the .git folder from the theme subfolder.

 cd themes
 git clone https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git ananke
 rm -rf ananke/.git
