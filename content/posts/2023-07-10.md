I've been a computer programmer for most of my life[^1]. I'm a fan of [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) as a great place to ask questions about any problems I bump into while developing code. Recently I've been working on [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/) and I noticed one name that often gave me good answers to my question was [Tanaike](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7108653/tanaike); his page on [Medium](https://medium.com/@tanaike) listed some other scripts that I thought were quite interesting. I liked the look of his [about Tanaike](https://tanaikech.github.io/about/) web page which prompted me to look behind the scenes on that page. The page was generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the Hugo theme being used appears to be [Blackburn](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/blackburn/), created by Yoshiharu Yamashita. I had a play with the instructions on the [Hugo quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) page and I quite like how fast it is, even on my dated hardware. The missing detail about the layouts setup took me a little while to work around.

It's been a while since I did any blogging any so I thought I might try comething with Hugo. I found the link about using [Hugo with Github Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/), and then another link about [Hugo on Netlify](https://www.scivision.dev/github-pages-to-netlify/). The idea of doing some blogging on free cloud space with a really simple (Oh not it's not) interface inspired me to start on this blog.
