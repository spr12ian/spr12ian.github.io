I'd like to not spend much money on this blog project. Perhaps pay for a domain but that's about it.

For draft posts, I'd like them to stay private, until I chose to publish them. The only way I can see to do this at present is to keep them in a private repository, and that appears to point to using GitLab rather than GitHub for my Git cloud storage.
