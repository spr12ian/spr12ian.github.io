Today I moan about my [Amazon/Aqara disappointment](/posts/2023-07-17) on the Facebook HA UK group, and ask the group what they think I should do.

## Hugo {#hugo}

Until now, I was struggling to work out how the home page of the Ananke theme example site displayed the 'Articles' link at the top of the page. Adding this line to hugo.toml made a really useful difference:
```
sectionPagesMenu = 'main'
```

Thanks to [Harry Cresswell](https://harrycresswell.com/writing/menus-in-hugo/) for the help.
