# Aqara

I ordered a few items during Amazon Prime Day.

1. [Aqara Smart Radiator Thermostat E1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0B6DTSGSJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) x 2
2. [Aqara Smart Hub E1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09BJCNCKM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
3. [Aqara Motion Sensor P1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0B9XZ1D51/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Only the radiator valves were delivered by Amazon but not the hub or the motion sensor although their website and app say it was all delivered. The valves don't work without the hub, so I'll be sending them back because I'd rather not pay full price for the hub and sensor which is what Amazon suggested. Very disappointing.

## Too many rabbit holes

+ NPM

It's nearly 3am and I have a toddler to look after in the morning.
