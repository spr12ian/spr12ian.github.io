## Chromebook Flex vs Windows 10 {#chromebook-windows}

I have a Lenovo K450 PC running Windows 10 in my office (spare bedroom) and an old Samsung laptop running ChromeOS (Chromebook Flex) in the living room.

I use Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS app (via WSL) on Windows 10 and use the Penguin Debian subsytem (via Terminal) on ChromeOS.

I hope to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to keep my two systems synchronised as I develop this blog.

Starting up Ubuntu on Windows is so much slower than starting up Debian on Chromebook Flex
