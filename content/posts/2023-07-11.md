## Chromebook Flex vs Windows 10

I have a Lenovo K450 PC running Windows 10 in my office (spare bedroom) and an old Samsung laptop running ChromeOS (Chromebook Flex) in the living room.

I use Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS app (via WSL) on Windows 10 and use the Penguin Debian subsytem (via Terminal) on ChromeOS

I hope to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to keep my two systems synchronised as I develop this blog.

My  granddaughter has a Google Mini speaker in her bedroom. I have set up an automation on Google Assistant on my phone which stops music on her speaker at 21:30 on weeks days. Unfortunately she then often just asks Google to play music afterwards when she's supposed to be ging to sleep. I have a BT Whole Home Wi-Fi mesh which I have now configured to pause the WiFi connection to her speaker at bedtime. Hopefully this will help her get to get a good night's sleep. I had first set it up with a custom daily schedule before realising that it had a bedtime option, which is ideal for a child's routine. i.e. Sunday to Thursday being stricter than the weekend.
