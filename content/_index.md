Welcome to my blog which is currently very experimental and a little bit time consuming.

I'll try to follow these guidelines as the blog progresses:

+ The title of my blog posts should always be a question
+ The description should give context to clarify the question
+ The post should explore and hopefully suggest an answer to the question

I'd like to rename this section from 'posts' to 'blog'.
