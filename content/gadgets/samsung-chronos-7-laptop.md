When I bought this Samsung Chronos 7 laptop it had Windows[^1] installed. It always had a problem with overheating and it was very slow to boot up, but when the battery life dwindled so much that I always have it plugged in then I eventually decided enough was enough. I took a risk and installed Google's Chrome OS Flex. This OS goes from strength to strength and I couldn't be more pleased that I decided to install it.

The Linux terminal (Penguin) running Debian is especially easy to get started with, and I'm using it for my new Hugo[^2] blog: this one!
