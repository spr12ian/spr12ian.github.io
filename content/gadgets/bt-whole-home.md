### BT Whole Home Wi-Fi mesh {#bt-whole-home}
My  granddaughter has a Google Mini speaker in her bedroom. I had set up an automation on Google Assistant on my phone which stops music on her speaker at 21:30 on weeks days.
> Hey Google, stop pink speaker!

Unfortunately she then often just asked Google to play music afterwards when she was supposed to be going to sleep. 

My BT Whole Home Wi-Fi mesh is now configured to pause the WiFi connection to her speaker at bedtime. Hopefully this will help her get a good night's sleep. I had first set it up with a custom daily schedule before realising that it had a bedtime option, which is ideal for a child's routine. i.e. Sunday to Thursday being stricter than the weekend evenings.
