The [Aqara Smart Radiator Thermostat E1] requires the [Aqara Hub E1]. It can be controlled via Apple Homekit and Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and more.

It can be used with the majority of water radiators including space heaters, towel warmers or even warm floors.

+ Zigbee 3.0 protocol
+ External temperature readings
+ Colourful backlit display
+ Geofencing and multi home support
+ Easy installation and compatibility
+ Configurable smart schedules

I don't like the way the batteries are inserted. In the battery compartment there are two battery slots for AA batteries. The springs in the slots are both at the same end of the slots. I usually put the batteries into gadgets with the negative end of the battery on the spring. Not in this case. The polarity is different on one of them. It took me a while to work out what I'd done wrong.

I connected the radiator thermostat [RT] to the radiator.
In the Aqara app I clicked to 'Add accessory'
I pressed the top of the [RT] until the lights came on.
I held the top down until a green light started flashing.
A few seconds later the hub and the [RT] were paired

I then had to assign the [RT] to a room, but the list of room names provided is very limited. My house has three bedrooms and I like to use room names to manage them. How can I use custom room names in the Aqara app?
