It's another bad eye morning.

My request for help on the [Aqara Facebook page] is still pending, waiting for an admin to approve it.

The request is fairly innocuos and uncontentious, I'd have thought:

>I have an A1ara E1 hub and a few Aqara E1 radiator thermostats.
>
>I use the app to connect the radiator thermostats to assign them to rooms, but the list of room names provided by the Aqara app is very limited. My house has three bedrooms and I like to use room names to manage them. How can I create/use custom room names in the Aqara app?

I had a brief look at [Homey]. To connect more than 5 devices you need a [Homey Premium] subscription at £2.99 per month unless you purchase a [Homey Pro] at £399. Likewise if you want various other features that are free with Home Assistant ([HA]). I'm sticking with [HA] for now, but will also have to do a better fairer price comparison later. [HA] is open source, [Homey] is closed.

I need to decide on a box to run [Home Assistant] as using VirtualBox on my main PC is not ideal.
