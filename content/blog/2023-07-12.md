### There's been some progress {#progress}

Years ago a cousin, who runs a small business, fell victim to ransomware; before ransomware was known to be a real thing. I could barely believe it at the the time because I thought those sort of criminals only targeted bigger fish. I was wrong and it cost the business a considerable amount of money to resolve the problem. Trying to deal with the issue with antivirus/antimalware software after the fact was a waste of time. Since then my security awareness has been heightened, but the passphrase on my ssh setup is overkill so I've removed it for now.

Early on in my long career I would have classed myself as a Unix Guru. I'd mastered both the blue book & the red book, as well as a thorough knowledge of K&R. I've forgotten a lot of it since then.

I can make changes on my phone, when I'm out and about, using the GitHub app. 

### Can I avoid git submodule? {#go-module}

 My quick fix to the themes submodule problem was to clone the theme and then delete the .git folder from the theme subfolder.

 cd themes
 git clone https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git ananke

 rm -rf ananke/.gits

 My better fix is to use a Go module approach

 My current go.mod file looks like:

``````
 module github.com/spr12ian/spr12ian.github.io

go 1.19

require github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo v0.0.0-20230624134853-c9856df47194 // indirect
```
