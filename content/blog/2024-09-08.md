Today is Cian's 4th birthday.
Charlie came over yesterday to clear out some of her stuff which resulted in me spending time looking after Cian rather than doing either of the two things I need to get done:
1. Landlord licence for Liverpool
2. Complaint letter for Shakespeare-Martineau's handing of Glenburnie

Unless Ian has other plans I'll try again with the landlord licence application today.
