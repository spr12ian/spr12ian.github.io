I need to find a receipt for a saw bought 2 years ago.

Brother Printer DCP-1612W - What is sleep mode and how to wake it up?
Why did I buy it? 3 years of toner. Laser. Price.

Why haven't they fixed it?
Doesn't work on Chromebooks.
Last firmware update was way too long ago.
Deep Sleep mode cannot be disabled.
This time adding a TCPIP port to the printer driver on my Windows PC fixed the problem.
