My right eye is not working again. My appointment at the eye hospital was scheduled for Friday 20th October. Yesterday they sent messages to say that appointment has been cancelled. They have rescheduled for Friday 8th December.

I recently signed up for full fibre broadband, getting the 1GB package from Community Fibre at £25 per month. The previous broadband router, a 5G box from Three at £20 per month, has gone to a family home nearby that needed a broadband facilty.

The previous broadband router was based on 192.168.0.1. The new router is based at 192.168.1.1 - Is it less effort to change the base, or not?

My Brother printer has stopped working via Wi-Fi. Resetting it is pain.

I need to submit a building control application today but the submit a plan website doesn't recognise my login details even though they sent me an activation code last night. When I activated using the code the website says they login has been set up.

I had hoped to spend time helping at Glenburnie today, but that won't happen due to right eye, planning application, Cian pickup, Bria pickup.

Submit a plan had a problem with my email address because it used a '+' symbol. I called their support team and the guy was very helpful. I'm now logged in to www.dataspacelive.co.uk, which is apparently one of the layers that submit a plan uses. Let's hope this application goes smoothly.
