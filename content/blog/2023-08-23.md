### home assistant: storage corruption detected for nest.event_media {#question}

http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/dashboard | Settings

Storage corruption detected for `nest.event_media`
The nest.event_media storage could not be parsed and has been renamed to /config/.storage/nest.event_media.corrupt.2023-08-15T07:45:40.011251+00:00 to allow Home Assistant to continue.

A default nest.event_media may have been created automatically.

If you made manual edits to the storage file, fix any syntax errors in /config/.storage/nest.event_media.corrupt.2023-08-15T07:45:40.011251+00:00, restore the file to the original path /config/.storage/nest.event_media, and restart Home Assistant. Otherwise, restore the system from a backup.

Click SUBMIT below to confirm you have repaired the file or restored from a backup.

The exact error was: invalid literal: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

I logged into a terminal session via HA VS code editor and removed the corrupt file. I restarted HA and when the same error message displayed I clicked on Submit to let HAS know the the error had been resolved.
