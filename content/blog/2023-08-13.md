### Why is my Google Drive on Windows 10 not synching correctly? {#question}
My Google Drive on Windows 10 is not synching correctly.

Windows Explorer (WE) show a subfolder with the extension (1) and Google Chrome (GC) shows the same folder name without the (1) extension. There are files showing on WE but not on GC.
