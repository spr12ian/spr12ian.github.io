A recent Window 10 update trashed one of my config files and caused me to panic this morning.

Previously when I started Windows app 'Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS' it started a session which was auto logged into my preferred default user. Today, there were two false starts with error messages before I rebooted, and then after the reboot 'Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS' started a session logged in as root. I didn't realise at first and started to panic when I couldn't find any of my files.

Why does Microsoft do this? It destroys all WSL credibility and leaves me with no confidence in continuing to develop using my current setup. I'm not sure I'll buy another Windows box when this one dies.

I've just watched the first episode of season 3 of the Prime Video TV animation 'Invincible'. How did they see the current Israel-Palestine war coming?
