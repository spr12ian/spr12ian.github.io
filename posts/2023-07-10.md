## Inspiration

I've been a computer programmer for most of my life. I'm a fan of [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (SO) as great place to ask questions about any problems I bump into while developing code. Recently I've been working on [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/) (GAS) and I noticed one name that often gave me good answers to my question was Tanaike. I had a look to see what *SO* had to say about him and I liked the look of one of the links I found which prompted me to look behind the scenes on that webpage. The page was generated by Hugo, and the Hugo theme being used appears to be Blackburn. I had a play with Hugo and I quite like how fast it is, even on my dated hardware. It's been a while since I did any blogging any I thought I might try comething with Hugo. I found the link about using Hugo with Github Pages, and then another link about Netlify. The idea of doing some blogging on free cloud space with a really simple (Oh not it's not) interface inspired me to start on this blog.
