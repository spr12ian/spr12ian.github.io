## It's all too much

My GitHub synchronisation efforts have gone a bit wrong. I may have to start again. My home page shows links to the first three posts that I've set up but not the contents of the posts, not even when I click on the links.

I must remember to remove the passphrase from my ssh setup.

Years ago a cousin, who runs a small business, fell victim to ransomware; before ransomware was known to be a real thing. I could barely believe it at the the time because I thought those sort of criminals only targeted bigger fish. I was wrong and it cost the business a considerable amount of money to resolve the problem. Trying to deal with the issue with antivirus/antimalware software after the fact was a waste of time. Since then my security awareness has been heightened, but the passphrase on my ssh setup is overkill.
